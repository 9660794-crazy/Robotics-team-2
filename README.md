Tennis robot

Mobile. The idea of the robot would be a spinning wheel tennis ball launcher and retreiver for athletes to practice with. The bot could hold up to 10 standard size tennis balls and would be able to be programmed to shoot at different distances or have  a random function. When the bot has shot all balls, it will make a beeping sound, then trace over the entire court (autonomous) and pick up balls with a vaccuum then put them back into the holder to be launched again. The controller would be able to choose the power and the target, so players could work on returning drop shots, serves, volleys, etc. The system to pick balls up would be like a bowling ball return wheel, where the tennis ball gets carried by friction and gravity into the hopper again. The robot would start at the tennis base line in the back, then would return there when it is done collecting balls. 

Justification:
Tennis is tiring especially when you are out there practicing in the heat. This bot would help you save energy and rest up while the bot gets your balls for you.

Bot objectives: Traversal with objects, retreival, and throwing.

Starter 10/21 Phase 1
Noah kergaye: i was member C and i contributed a lot to the team with my ideas and I helped to adjust our robot accordingly.

Liam Greene: I was member A and planned the future for our bot and sketched it out.
Grant helped me with as member B and we also started building a google doc with future plans and potential tests etc.

Shun: was member D and aided in building, he will implement code when the motors are set.

Starter 10/23 Phase 2
Noah kergaye: I did lots of building and rtaking apart with our robot shun assisted me in doing so and together we were able to come up with a sufficient design for our robot and our intake system.

Shunsuke: i helped Noah create our robots intake design and did lots of work cause Im so amazing I also helped gather aprtsw and did lots of major coding in order for our intake system to work.

Grant Hersey: I gather the part neccicary to build the suopports for the storage system, I also helped Atched the supports. I also added a few pictures of our robot in the repo.

Liam Greene: I finished the sketch and helped build and get parts (All in the repo image files)

Noah kergaye: I did lots of building and rtaking apart with our robot shun assisted me in doing so and together we were able to come up with a sufficient design for our robot and our intake system.

Starter Phase 3 oct 28
Noah kergaye: I did lots of buidling with my assisstant shunsuke and we made our intake system and attached the motors to our robot I also took a few photos of the bot in order for a good visualization.
Liam Greene was not here- very sick
Shunsuke: I did lots of coding and building with Noah we attahced the motor and designed and planned out our intake system, the code was kind of hard but I got it.
Grant Hersey: I documented and took a few photos for the repo I also helped noah in builiding a lot.


Starter Phase 4 Oct 30
Grant Hersey: I added photos from all stages of the robot to the repo and helped complete the intake system as well as got started on the contanment system for the tennis balls.
Liam Greene: I helped plan out future plans and Ideas. I talked through future plans about implementing a flap to allow tennis balls to be pulled in and shot out. I also put away parts to tidy up our box and I grabbed new parts to hold the box.
Noah: I helped build the bot and implementend the new motor into the code with Shun.
