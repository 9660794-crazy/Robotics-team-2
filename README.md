Tennis robot

Mobile. The idea of the robot would be a spinning wheel tennis ball launcher and retreiver for athletes to practice with. The bot could hold up to 10 standard size tennis balls and would be able to be programmed to shoot at different distances or have  a random function. When the bot has shot all balls, it will make a beeping sound, then trace over the entire court (autonomous) and pick up balls with a vaccuum then put them back into the holder to be launched again. The controller would be able to choose the power and the target, so players could work on returning drop shots, serves, volleys, etc. The system to pick balls up would be like a bowling ball return wheel, where the tennis ball gets carried by friction and gravity into the hopper again. The robot would start at the tennis base line in the back, then would return there when it is done collecting balls. 

Justification:
Tennis is tiring especially when you are out there practicing in the heat. This bot would help you save energy and rest up while the bot gets the balls for you.

Bot objectives: Traversal with objects, retreival, and throwing.
