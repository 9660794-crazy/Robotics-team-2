# Team Name : THE KINGS

## Robot Name : Geyser

### Robot Description:
Mobile. The robot's purpose would be to shoot water balloons at people by driving around and having an axis for the launcher to aim at. It would be a gear system where gears pull a slinghot back and let the water balloons release. The water balloon would be a bunch o balloon as they are small and cheap and uniform. The robot would be black and quiet and sleek to blend in and surprise Mr. Kapptie. The water balloon would either be held in a pouch that gets pulled back or potentially a box with a pinball mechanism. The robot would also have a tube filled with balloons above it (probably 3) so it automatically reloads after fired. The robot could have a laser to help aim or a mini camera to help aim. Another idea would be to have a motion detection sensor to automatically shoot when someone walks in front of it. (stationary).
