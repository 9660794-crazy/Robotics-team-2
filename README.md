## Robot Name : Wimbledon

### Robot Description:
Mobile. The robot's purpose would be to shoot water balloons at people by driving around and having an axis for the launcher to aim at. It would be a gear system where gears pull a slinghot back and let the water balloons release. The water balloon would be a bunch o balloon as they are small and cheap and uniform. The robot would be black and quiet and sleek to blend in and surprise Mr. Kapptie. The water balloon would either be held in a pouch that gets pulled back or potentially a box with a pinball mechanism. The robot would also have a tube filled with balloons above it (probably 3) so it automatically reloads after fired. The robot could have a laser to help aim or a mini camera to help aim. Another idea would be to have a motion detection sensor to automatically shoot when someone walks in front of it. (stationary).

NEW TENNIS ROBOT:

Mobile. The idea of the robot would be a spinning wheel tennis ball launcher and retreiver for athletes to practice with. The bot could hold up to 40 standard size tennis balls and would be able to be programmed to shoot at different distances or have  a random function. When the bot has shot all balls, it will make a beeping sound, then trace over the entire court (autonomous) and pick up balls with a vaccuum then put them back into the holder to be launched again. The controller would be able to choose the power and the target, so players could work on returning drop shots, serves, volleys, etc. The system to pick balls up would be like a bowling ball return wheel, where the tennis ball gets carried by friction and gravity into the hopper again. The robot would start at the tennis base line in the back, then would return there when it is done collecting balls.
